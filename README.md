[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/Tada-Project/tada.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Tada-Project/tada) [![codecov.io](http://codecov.io/github/Tada-Project/tada/coverage.svg?branch=master)](http://codecov.io/github/Tada-Project/tada?branch=master) [![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-orange.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

This repository contains the source code and usage instructions for a tool
called "Tada: auTomAtic orDer-of-growth Analysis" that is implemented in the
Python 3 language. The tool systematically runs a doubling experiment to
ascertain the likely worst-case order-of-growth function for an arbitrary Python
function. This documentation provides a brief overview about how to run the
tool, its provided test suite, and more. Please note that this is a work in
progress tool and potential future works are detailed in the `Future Works`
section below.

## Installing and Testing Tada

This program uses [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) for installation.
Once you have installed `pipenv` you can run the test suite for Tada's functions
by typing the following in your terminal window:

- `pipenv install --dev`
- `pipenv shell`
- `pipenv run pytest`

If you want to collect the coverage of the provided test suite, then you can
run:

- `pipenv run pytest --cov-config pytest.cov --cov`

If you want to collect the coverage of the provided test suite and see what
lines of code are not covered, then you can run:

- `pytest --cov-config pytest.cov --cov --cov-report term-missing`

## Using Tada

Since the Tada tool is currently under heavy development, it is not yet feature
complete. In the future, its documentation will feature examples of how to run
the tool to automatically suggest the likely worst-case order-of-growth function
for a provided Python function.

If you want to run the tool, then you can run:

```bash
tada_a_bigoh.py [-h] --directory DIRECTORY --module MODULE --function FUNCTION --types TYPES
                       [TYPES ...] [--schema SCHEMA] --startsize STARTSIZE [--expect EXPECTEDBIGOH]
```

You can learn about Tada's checks and defaults by typing python3
`tada_a_bigoh.py -h` in your terminal window and then reviewing the following
output.

```
usage: tada_a_bigoh.py [-h] --directory DIRECTORY --module MODULE --function FUNCTION --types TYPES
                       [TYPES ...] [--schema SCHEMA] [--startsize STARTSIZE] [--steps STEPS]
                       [--runningtime RUNNINGTIME] [--expect EXPECTEDBIGOH]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --directory DIRECTORY
                        Package directory with functions to analyze (default: None)
  --module MODULE       Module name with functions to analyze (default: None)
  --function FUNCTION   Name of the module's function to analyze (default: None)
  --types TYPES [TYPES ...]
                        Parameter types for function to analyze, hypothesis, or hypothesis-clean
                        (default: None)
  --schema SCHEMA       The path to the jsonschema (default: None)
  --startsize STARTSIZE
                        Starting size of the doubling experiment (default: 1)
  --steps STEPS         Maximum rounds of experiment (default: 5)
  --runningtime RUNNINGTIME
                        Maximum running time (default: 200)
  --expect EXPECTEDBIGOH
                        Expected Result comparing to the result provided by TADA tool, then store
                        important variables to experiment_data.csv

Sample usage: python3 tada_a_bigoh.py --directory /Users/myname/projectdirectory --module
modulename.file --function function_name --types int
```

Tada adopts `Hypothesis` and `Hypothesis-jsonschema` to generate random data for the
provided Python function. Therefore, we encourage you to create a file of
a JSON array that contains JSON schemas for each parameter passed into the provided
function. Also, `Hypothesis` will raise warnings when generating data for functions
with `return` statements. In this version of Tada, we also encourage you remove the
`return` statements temporarily for the purpose of the experiment.

To specify the data generation strategy, we encourage you to specify `--types TYPES [TYPES ...]`
with `hypothesis-clean`, `hypothesis`, or one of the generate types:
`int, int_list, char, char_list, boolean, string, float`. `hypothesis-clean` works
best for function has a single integer list argument; `hypothesis` handles all types
while the data generation time is counted into the experiment.

A sample JSON schema for a list of integers can be found here:
[speed-surprises](https://github.com/Tada-Project/speed-surprises/blob/master/schema.json).
Specify the `maxItems` and `minItems` with the start size in JSON schema.
Use the command line checks `--startsize STARTSIZE` as well, for this will be the
starting size of the doubling experiment.

For further usage of JSON schemas and how to write them for various data types:
please refer to [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type.html)

When completed, Tada will be used to estimate the worst-case time complexity for
Python functions.

Here is an example of Tada being used in conjunction with functions in the
[Speed-Surprises repository](https://github.com/gkapfham/speed-surprises).

```bash
$ pipenv run python tada_a_bigoh.py --directory ../speed-surprises/ --module speedsurprises.lists.sorting --function insertion_sort --types hypothesis-clean --schema ../speed-surprises/schema.json --startsize 50 --expect "O(n)"

## Recording Multiple Tada Experiments' Result

The command argument `--expect EXPECTEDBIGOH` is needed for storing important
variables to `experiment_data.csv`. A string of the expected Big-Oh growth ratio should
be followed. (ie. `"O(1)"`, `"O(n^2)"`) The following variables suppose to be stored:

- `EXPERIMENT_RELIABILITY`:  dummy variable := 1 if the result provided by tada tool is
  what user expected.
- `CPU_TYPE`: string := type information of CPU.
- `CPU_TEMP`: string := temperature information of CPU.
- `CPU_COUNT`: int := the number of physical CPUs.
- `TOTAL_RUNNING_TIME`: int := total time spent on running experiment.
- `QUIT_BY_MAX_RUNTIME`: dummy variable := 1 if the tool exits by reaching the
  max_runtime.
- `QUIT_BY_INDICATOR`: dummy variable := 1 if the tool exits by having indicator larger
  than the indicator bound.
- `QUIT_BY_BACKFILL`: dummy variable := 1 if the tool exits by having multiple times of
  back-filling.
- `MEM_MAX_RSS`: int := track of current machine memory usage.
- `MEM_PEAK_PAGEFILE_USAGE`: int := track of current machine memory usage (windows).
- `OS`: string := information of current operating system.
- `INDICATOR_VALUE`: int := the value of the indicator boundary user set.
- `BACKFILL_TIMES`: int := the value of the back-fill time boundary user set.
- `PYPERF_AVG_EXPERIMENT_ROUNDS`: int := the average loops of all benchmarks in the
  experiment, the measurement of difficulty for PyPerf to analyze the target algorithm.
- `PYPERF_LAST_TWO_EXPERIMENT_ROUNDS_RATIO`: int := the growth ratio of the total loops
  in the last two benchmarks, the total loops is usually decreasing when the input get
  larger, the measurement of reliability of the experiment analysis.
- `NAME_OF_EXPERIMENT`: string := experiment information.
- `PYTHON_VERSION`: string := current version of Python.
- `DATA_GEN_STRATEGY`: string := the chosen data generation strategy

## Adding New Features to Tada

You can follow these steps to add a new feature if you are already a
collaborator on the project. If you want to add a new feature, please ensure
that it is accompanied by high coverage test cases and that you do not break any
of the existing test cases or features. First, you should type the following
command, substituting the name of your feature for the word `featurename`.

- `git checkout -b new-featurename`
- `git checkout master`
- `git push -u origin new-featurename`

Finally, you should open a pull request on the GitHub repository for the new
branch that you have created. This pull request should describe the new feature
that you are adding and give examples of how to run it on the command line. Of
course, if you are not a collaborator on this project, then you will need to
fork the repository, add your new feature, document and test it as appropriate,
and then create a pull request.

## Future Works

- Improve functionality of current analysis functions.
- Refactor code, specifically `tada_a_bigoh.py` file.
  - Consider making the functionality of generating the Results Table a class.
  - Consider separating the analysis features into separate functions.
- Clean up and reformat the output from the program to make it more readable
  and user friendly.
